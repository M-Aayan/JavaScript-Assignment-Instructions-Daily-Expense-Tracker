## 📌 About

This assignment was created as part of a JavaScript learning project.  
The goal was to practice:

- Taking **user input** using `prompt()`
- Performing **array operations**
- Writing **functions** to calculate totals and averages
- Displaying output using `document.write()`

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 🔁 The program prompts the user 7 times to enter their daily expenses (one for each day of the week).
2. ❌ If a non-numeric value is entered, the user is shown an error (`alert`) and that input is ignored.
3. ✅ Valid expenses are stored in an array.
4. 🧮 Two functions are used to:
   - Calculate total weekly expenses
   - Calculate average daily expense
5. 📄 The final results are shown using `document.write()` on the page.
